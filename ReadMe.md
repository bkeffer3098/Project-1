# Project 1

**Background**

Food plays a crucial role in our day to day life. From weekly grocery trips, to a nice meal out with friends, or just grabbing a bag of chips at your local gas station, it is safe to say that food is woven into the fabric of our existence: culturally, socially, and economically. The United States food industry, in particular has experienced a significant boom in the last decade. Noticeable shifts in consumer behavior has been evident through the growing demand for organic, more sustainable products, alternative protein sources, and a rise in takeout and delivery services such as UberEats, DoorDash, and HelloFresh.

COVID-19 first emerged in late 2019, spreading like wildfire throughout the rest of the world. COVID-19 not only distrupted public health, but every single aspect of daily life, including the food industry. The food industry now faced a unique challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic. With disruptions in the supply chain, business closures, and changes in consumer behavior, many corporations and restaurants had to make a choice: adapt or crumble under the pressure of the ongoing pandemic.

**Our Project**

In order to better understand how the food industry has changed in the last decade, we chose to look at the bigger picture and analyze the financial changes the United States food industry has gone through in the last decade, starting from 2010 and ending in 2022. While not the focal point of our project, we chose to analyze how the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the steady growth of the food industry from 2019-2020. Furthermore, we chose to focus these changes from a state-level perspective, directly contrasting the food industry's progress in the most populous states, as well as on the East Coast for a more localized perspective.

**The Data**

* Our data came directly from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Expenditure Series
    * A comprehensive data set that measures the U.S. food system by quantifying the  value of food acquired (food and beverage sales) and the value of food produced at home.
    * Food expenditure data are estimated at the national and state level
    * We analyzed sales of Food At Home (FAH) and Food Away From Home (FAFH) 
        * On an annual and monthly basis
        * Using constant dollar, rather than nominal sales
* We focused on line graphs, bar plots, and pie graphs in order to analyze and visualize the data throughout the decade.

**Analysis**

* As prices within the industry grew, so did the sales throughout the years
* COVID-19 severely impacted the normal rate of growth of the food industry, shifting its growth in a new direction
* Despite months of quarantining and changes to routines, a new normalcy has been found and the typical growth in the industry has returned, with particular growth in takeout and delivery services.

**Limitations & Future Study**

If we were to explore this subject differently in the future, our group would focus on:
* Supplementing the data analysis through quantitative means, rather than just through visual trends.
* Looking into the Alcohol Sales, which had also gone through a significant change in the last decade.
* Visit this data again three years from now to track pre, during, and post Covid levels.
* Take a deeper dive into state per capita spending
* Loss of Free and Reduced lunches for students impacting Food At Home (FAH)
